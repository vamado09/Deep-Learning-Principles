# Deep-Learning-Principles
Projects and problems related to Deep Learning

This repository contains 5 Deep Learning tasks and 1 mini project. For the mini project, I had the idea to create and combine one Unsupervised Model (pre-trained step) and 1 Supervised Model to correctly classify the animal class (class: 1 to 7). It is important to state that the data came from UCI Irvine while the created models were AutoEncoder and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Every detail and explanation are within the mini project notebook, pdf, and html including data information and implementation.

Google Colab was used for all assignments.
